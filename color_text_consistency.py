Color code for Word documents (DOCX): Colors of consciousness
O.Colizoli 2025
Python 3.9

Notes
-------------
The following packages need to be installed: python-docx, pandas, numpy
>> pip install python-docx pandas numpy
---
To run:
>> python color_text_consistency.py
You will be prompted with the book name and whether you want to change the font type and size.
---
This script will loop through individual letters and reformat each occurrence of a letter with a specific color (RGB);
Each letter is also assigned a consistency value: e.g. if "a" is 100% consistent, then all "a"s will receive the same color. 
If "a" is 75% consistent, then it will receive a different color with 25% probability. 
The other colors are chosen from a uniform distribution.

If 'change_color' is True, the script will run the coloring-consistency process described above. 
If 'change_font' is True, the script will replace the entire document's font typeface and font size. 
The reformatted document is saved as a new document. 
Fonts need to be already installed on the computer.
---
Books are found in the directory: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'books')
The name of book input at the prompt should exclude the 'docx' file extension: "books/sub-{}_book{}.docx".format(subject, book_number)
The new colored version will be saved as: "books/{}_processed.docx".format(book_name)
---
Letters and colors to be changed are imported from a CSV file in the directory: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'colors')
The CSV file with colors needs to have the following columns: 'letter', 'r', 'g', 'b'
Letters are case-sensitive.
---
Character formatting is applied at the docx.text.run.Run level. 
The script can be adjusted to change the font typeface, size, bold, italic, 
and underline of single letters or the whole document.
A Run object has a read-only font property providing access to a Font object. 
A run's Font object (docx.text.run.Run.font) provides properties for getting and setting the character formatting for that run.
E.g. current_run.font.color.rgb = RGBColor(r, g, b) 
---
The function for isolating individual letters as runs, isolate_run(), was taken from here:

    characters of the paragraph have (start, end) of (0, 3). `end` is not the index of
    the last character. These correspond to `match.start()` and `match.end()` of a regex
    match object and `s[start:end]` of Python slice notation.
